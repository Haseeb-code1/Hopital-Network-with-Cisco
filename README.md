# 🏥 Hospital Network System – Main Block & D Block

A professional-grade hospital network simulation designed with enterprise networking principles.  
This project models a **two-building hospital infrastructure** (Main Block & D Block) using real-world networking protocols and services.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This system represents a hospital with:

- 🏢 **Main Block**
  - Emergency Department  
  - OPD  
  - Reception  
  - Billing  
  - IT Department  
  - Server Room  

- 🏥 **D Block**
  - Pharmacy  
  - Laboratory  
  - Operation Theater  

Both buildings are interconnected through routers and cloud infrastructure to simulate real hospital-wide communication.

---

## 🌐 Network Architecture

- Multi-router topology  
- Inter-building communication via cloud  
- Department-wise segmentation  
- Centralized server room  
- Scalable design  

Redundant paths ensure better reliability and fault tolerance.

## 🔧 Technologies & Protocols Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|--------|
| RIP        | Dynamic routing between routers |
| FTP        | File transfer between departments |
| SMTP       | Email communication |
| HTTP       | Web services |
| DNS        | Domain name resolution |
| DHCP       | Automatic IP assignment |
| Cloud      | Inter-building connectivity |

## 🧠 Key Features

- Dynamic routing using RIP  
- Automatic IP management using DHCP  
- Centralized services (DNS, FTP, SMTP, HTTP)  
- Department-wise isolation  
- Realistic hospital data flow simulation  
- Cloud-based inter-building link

## 🗂️ Network Layout

### Main Block
- Emergency Department  
- OPD  
- Reception  
- Billing  
- IT Department  
- Server Room (DNS, DHCP, FTP, SMTP, HTTP servers)

### D Block
- Pharmacy  
- Laboratory  
- Operation Theater

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Each department is connected via switches.
2. Switches connect to routers.
3. Routers use RIP for dynamic routing.
4. Buildings communicate through a cloud network.
5. DHCP assigns IP addresses automatically.
6. DNS resolves domain names.
7. HTTP hosts hospital web services.
8. SMTP handles mail services.
9. FTP manages file transfers.
